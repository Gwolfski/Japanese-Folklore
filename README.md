Mod for CDDA that adds a variety of youkai and kami to interact with, or even become. All builds are currently for the experimental versions of C:DDA. Special thanks to Bismuth Borealis for laying the groundwork for the kitsune.

Latest update changes the kitsune tranformation abilites. Rather than being directly linked to a mutation ability, the ability to shapeshift is now controlled through a spell. The precursor to the transformation spell is obtained when you reach the kitsune threshold, and can be leveled until you obtain the transformation ability. The transformation has no effect on mutations outside of the kitsune branch.

Latest in experimental: A few Ninjutsu "ninpo" abilities have been added, though they require debug to access currently. Reworked how kitsune mutation works. Star Pearls no longer mutate on their own, but can still be used to create mutagen. Those who have reached the Kitsune threshold can use pearls to expand their powers and gain additional tails. Rates of success scale with character intelligence.
