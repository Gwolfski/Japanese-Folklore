Mod for CDDA that adds a variety of youkai and kami to interact with, or even become. Special thanks to Bismuth Borealis for laying the groundwork for the kitsune.

Latest update changes the kitsune tranformation abilites. Rather than being directly linked to a mutation ability, the ability to shapeshift is now controlled through a spell. The precursor to the transformation spell is obtained when you reach the kitsune threshold, and can be leveled until you obtain the transformation ability. The transformation has no effect on mutations outside of the kitsune branch.
